### Planar reflections for Unityâ€™s Universal Render Pipeline.

![alt text](https://github.com/dead-folk/planar-reflections/wiki/Images/Home00.png?raw=true)
*An example of global and local reflections.*

A system for defining and rendering planar reflection cameras in Unity's Universal Render Pipeline. It supports **Global** mode, where a single reflection camera can be used across an entire scene (useful for water and other large reflective surfaces) and **Local** mode, where a list of **Renderers** can be defined to receive reflections (useful for smaller surfaces like wall mirrors).

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/dead-folk/planar-reflections/wiki/Home) for more information.
